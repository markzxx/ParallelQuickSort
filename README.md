This is a sample about implementing quick sort in multithreading.

A special pivot selection method is used to increase performance.

The experiment result is 

size: 100000000

multiple threads sorting time is 2750 ms

single thread sorting time is 9626 ms

experiment machine is i7 8-core 3.5Ghz
